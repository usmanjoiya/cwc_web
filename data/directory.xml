        As a former professor of Peace and Conflict Studies, I have a deep conviction in the potential for change through self-awareness, which led me to pursue clinical psychology. I specialize as a trauma-informed psychotherapist, utilizing EMDR and IFS methods, with a focus on psychodynamic and systemic approaches. As a native of Greece, I am fluent in Greek, French and Italian, and I can engage in conversational Spanish. My diverse background and expertise allow me to connect with clients from various cultural and linguistic backgrounds, empowering them to explore self-knowledge and drive positive transformations.
